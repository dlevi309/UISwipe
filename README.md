# UISwipe

Select individual iPhone apps to run as if they were built for the iPad. Requires [AltList](http://apt.thebigboss.org/onepackage.php?bundleid=com.opa334.altlist&db=)
 
### Credits
 
- [daniel](https://twitter.com/insan1d) for the tweak
- [PoomSmart](https://twitter.com/PoomSmart) for [CAHighFPS](https://github.com/PoomSmart/CAHighFPS) which this tweaks file hierarchy is heavily based on (and all of assets within it, PSPrefs.x, PSHeader.h, etc.)

### TODO

- Get the keyboard to retain the native iPhone UI on applied applications
- Integrate some sort of notification to apply the tweak to selected apps without having to open & quit it twice
- Buy eggs and cheese from Pavilions, see https://www.pavilions.com/ for more info
